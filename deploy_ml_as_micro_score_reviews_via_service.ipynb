            "for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \n",
            "to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \n",
            "the book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \n",
            "in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \n",
            "if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \n",
            "getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \n",
            "the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \n",
            "it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \n",
            "when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \n",
            "abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \n",
            "upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \n",
            "i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \n",
            "in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \n",
            "it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \n",
            "and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \n",
            "don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \n",
            "now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \n",
            "the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \n",
            "oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \n",
            "even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \n",
            "ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \n",
            "i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \n",
            "the film , however , is all good . \n",

            "[{'document': ' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n', 'sentiment': 0.08977209}]\n",
